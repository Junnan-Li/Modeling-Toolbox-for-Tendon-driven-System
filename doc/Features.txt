Classes:

Hand:
    The hand is composed by base and fingers. The base is assumed as serial structure, while
    the fingers are assumed connecting to the ee of the last base.

Finger:
    w_T_base: private property. using set_base
    w_T_base_inhand: this is used when the finger is connect to the hand object, 
                     as the world frame is changed to the previous finger
                    
    set_joint_limits_on/off: consider the limits_q while update_finger
