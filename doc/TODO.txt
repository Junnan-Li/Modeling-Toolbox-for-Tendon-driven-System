Classes:
1. tendon class 
    change the name of tendon class (robotic, no via point) to distinguish muscle (human, includes pathway, parameters)
2. muscle class: 
    includes viapoints, muscle parameters, 
    list of viapoints & obstacles in sequence, and a function calculate the length with given q
    
3. viapoint class: 
    attached links
    position in the link coord.
 
4. obstacle classes
    includes several obstacles (sphere, cylinder, ...)
    
    attached links
    relative position and orientation
    size parameter
    
5. finger class
    update_list_viapoints: not efficient

6. muscle class

  

Dynamics:
1. floating base inverse dynamic 
2. Mass matric, C torque 
3. symbolic inverse dynamics
4. regressor form for identification

Optimization:
1. metrics
2. optimization framework example

Interface:
1. Mujoco model output
