ToDo:
    1. in the Hand object, the base of each finger has a wrong index_inhand value (4)
    2. 

Classes:
1. tendon class 
    change the name of tendon class (robotic, no via point) to distinguish muscle (human, includes pathway, parameters)
2. muscle class: 
    includes viapoints, muscle parameters, 
    list of viapoints & obstacles in sequence, and a function calculate the length with given q
    
3. viapoint class: 
    attached links
    position in the link coord.
 
4. obstacle classes
    define the position & orientation according to the link. 
    b_T_obs will be updatged by calling Link.update_link_obstacles and 
    w_T_obs will be update by calling Finger.update_obstacles
    

    
5. finger class
    a. update_list_viapoints: not efficient
    b. cal_all_Muscle_momentarm:
        using numeric differentiation method 
    c. change the invkin functions to the new version as for the hand object
    d. The way of defining the kinematic chain is limited. maybe define links and associated frame and then
        define the joint axes within the frame


6. muscle class
    muscle object comprises the properties of name and via points. all via points are summarized in a list.
    

7. hand class 
a hand object comprises several fingers and base, enabling hybride kinematic, dynamics,
floating base, 
    a. in test_hand.m, the merge of base and finger need to remove the first row of mdh parameter of 
finger, and the endeff frame of base should be well-aligned. The first joint of the finger is attached 
to the endeffector of base.
