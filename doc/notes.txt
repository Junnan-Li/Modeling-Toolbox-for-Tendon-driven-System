Classes:
1. tendon class 
    change the name of tendon class (robotic, no via point) to distinguish muscle (human, includes pathway, parameters)
2. muscle class: 
    includes viapoints, muscle parameters, 
    list of viapoints & obstacles in sequence, and a function calculate the length with given q
    
3. viapoint class: 
    attached links
    position in the link coord.
 
4. obstacle classes
    includes several obstacles (sphere, cylinder, ...)
    
    attached links
    relative position and orientation
    size parameter
    
5. finger class
    a. update_list_viapoints: not efficient
    b. cal_all_Muscle_momentarm:
        using numeric differentiation method 
6. muscle class

7. hand class 
a hand object comprises several fingers and base, enabling hybride kinematic, dynamics,
floating base, 
    

  

Dynamics:
1. floating base inverse dynamic 
*2. Mass matric, C torque 
*3. symbolic inverse dynamics
4. regressor form for identification



Optimization:
1. metrics
2. optimization framework example

Interface:
1. Mujoco model output
